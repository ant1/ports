The RegLookup project is devoted to direct analysis of Windows NT-based registry
files. RegLookup is released under the GNU GPL, and is implemented in ANSI C.
RegLookup provides command line tools, a C API, and a Python module for
accessing registry data structures. The project has a focus on providing tools
for digital forensic examiners (though is useful for many purposes), and
includes algorithms for retrieving deleted data structures from registry hives.
